Change of requirement from original files:

Error with openslide-python==1.1.1.
When pip install, error config message (need to reproduce the error to put it here) then I downloaded 1.1.2.

Error with tensorflow-gpu==1.12.0
ImportError: libcublas.so.9.0: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory
Check the issue on GitHub tensorflow:
https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/15604
Do: 
conda install -c anaconda cudatoolkit=9.0 cudnn=7

As indicated in the github README, have to do:
conda install -c conda-forge openjpeg

Also to add:
pip install requests
conda install -c conda-forge openslide
conda install -c bioconda openslide-python
( conda upgrade libpng ? - to see whith last issue)
